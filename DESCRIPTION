Description: Many data analysis outputs need to leave the R ecosystem shortly after they’re created. The goal of this package is thus to provide basic “outbox” functionality to the R data analysis workflow. This is achieved with a standardized wrapper function - syntactic sugar using existing packages - that behaves the same way across common types of output and file formats.
