Many data analysis outputs need to leave the R ecosystem shortly after they're created. The goal of this package is thus to provide basic "outbox" functionality to the R data analysis workflow. This is achieved with a standardized wrapper function - syntactic sugar using existing packages - that behaves the same way across common types of output and file formats.

## Installation

The outbox package is still in early development. You can install the development version of outbox from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('iancero/outbox')
```

## Examples

Outbox provides a single function `write_output()` designed to make your analysis workflow similar to a physical paper workflow. When an item is complete, you simply drop it in the your outbox. 

### Same function across inputs/outputs

The outbox experience should be the same, regardless of whether the specific output is a `gtsummary` table headed to a `.xlsx` workbook... 

```{r}
library(gtsummary)
library(outbox)

my_table <- tbl_summary(mtcars)

write_output(my_table, 'my_excel_workbook.xlsx')
```

...or a `ggplot` figure headed to a `.docx` document. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

my_plot <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point()

write_output(my_plot, 'my_word_doc.docx')
```

### Keep appending to the same outbox

Much like a physical outbox, the `write_output()` is also designed to simply append each new output object to the end of the existing file. This allows you to simply set the outbox path at the beginning and drop new output there as it is created.

```{r}
my_outbox <- 'my_word_doc.docx'

plot_1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point()

plot_2 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt)) +
  geom_histogram()

write_output(plot_1, my_outbox)
write_output(plot_2, my_outbox)
```

On subsequent calls, you can even drop the path argument for convenience.

```{r}
my_table <- gtsummary::tbl_summary(mtcars)

write_output(my_table)
```

### Add labels

Again with a physical outbox, you sometimes want to add brief sticky notes to remind you what you are looking at later. In the outbox package, that is achieved by passing a string to the `label` parameter of `write_output()`. That label is then used as the sheet name for `.xlsx` files or as a [level 1 header](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/headers-and-footers-in-word-b693b4fb-0d23-4109-a621-1b828b824454) above the output in a `.docx` file.

```{r}
write_output(my_table, label = 'Descriptive Statistics')
```

### Add captions

Basic support for captions of figures (and in the name of symmetry, also for tables) is provided too. Depending on the type of document, the caption will either appear above (`.xlsx`) or below (`.docx`) the output itself.

```{r}
fig_caption <- 'This figure depicts the relationship between weight and MPG'

write_output(my_plot, label = 'Wt-vs-MPG Fig', caption = fig_caption)
```

### label vs caption

The difference between the `label` and `caption` is that label has a special role in the document it is sent to. In a `.docx` document, it will be a header at the top of a page. Visually, that will make it look more like a title. It has the additional benefit of being automatically detectable by Word's table of contents and other features. Likewise, `labels` in `.xlsx` documents will serve as sheet names. Because `label` will serve this titular role in both documents, it should ideally be short and simply used to help the document recipient locate whatever they are looking for.

In contrast, the `caption` string is just plain text that will appear either above (`.xlsx`) or below (`.docx`) the output itself. It is suitable for much longer descriptions, capable of providing detail and context to the reader.

Note, neither `label` nor `caption` support anything other than plain text (e.g., Rmarkdown).


## Why do we need outbox?

Although many analysis output classes and their associated packages already have reliable mechanisms for exporting an output object, these functions are variable from package to package - and sometimes even within functions of the same package.

For example, the excellent `gtsummary` package uses `flextable` to export tables to `.docx` files and `huxtable` to export those same tables to `.xlsx` files. This is a good choice that results in high quality output to both sources, but creates a variable workflow across the two types of output.^[To be fair to `gtsummary`, which is admittedly one of my own favorite packages, this is a cherry-picked example to demonstrate a point. Elsewhere in that package, several additional output mechanisms are available - many of which are helpfully similar from function to function.] 

To see this in action, note that when we want to send an `gtsummary` table (`trial_tbl`) to an `.xlsx` document, only one step is required.

```{r}
library(gtsummary)

trial_tbl <- trial |> 
  tbl_summary()

xlsx_path <- 'my_excel_workbook.xlsx'

trial_tbl |>
  gtsummary::as_hux_xlsx(file = xlsx_path)
```

In contrast, when we want to send the same `gtsummary` table to a word document, we need two steps. We also need to work with a different argument for our target file (i.e., `file =` for `.xlsx` vs `path =` for `.docx`).

```{r}
docx_path <- 'my_word_doc.docx'

trial_tbl |>
  gtsummary::as_flex_table() |>
  flextable::save_as_docx(path = docx_path)
```

In each individual case, this non-standardization is only a minor issue. However, a single data analysis will likely involve several differed output classes, in turn exported to multiple different file types. The complexity grows quickly, slowing down the analysis process and making debugging more difficult. 

The approach outbox takes to resolve these problems is to offer a single wrapper function `write_output()`, which is ready to receive multiple output classes and output file extensions - at least for the most common classes and file types.

## Supported output classes and file types

Currently, the supported output classes include: 

- `"gtsummary"`
- `"ggplot"` 

Supported output file formats include:

- `.xlsx`
- `.docx`.

Additional output classes and file formats are currently under consideration for the future. However, any future support will only ever be expanded to (a) especially common classes and formats, for which (b) there are already existing specialty export functions that can be streamlined with `write_output()`. This is because outbox aspires only to streamlining, not adding functionality or additional control (see below).

## Package scope: What outbox will *not* do

Note, outbox has intentionally small aspirations. It's goal is only to standardize and streamline existing output infrastructure and provide only very basic convenience improvements (e.g., adding simple labels to output during export). It is not intended to add any meaningful functionality that doesn't already exist. To abide by those constraints, outbox will NOT:

- **Write multiple objects in a single call**. Although this functionality was initially considered for `write_output()`, experience has shown that it often reduces the interpretability of the files it produces. To discourage the practice of dropping collections of (often unlabelled) output objects into files all at once, `write_output()` does not support lists of objects.
- **Wrangle output objects into the correct format.** If you are not starting with an object in a supported format, outbox is unable to help.
- **Tweak look and feel (formatting) of outputs.** The outbox package is designed simply to call existing packages in a standardized way. If you want your output formatted differently than the defaults given by the packages on which outbox depends, it will be important to use those packages directly.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
# keep these to clean up your working directory during README.md builds
file.remove('my_excel_workbook.xlsx')
file.remove('my_word_doc.docx')
```
