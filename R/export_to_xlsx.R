#' Export a \code{gtsummary} table object to a \code{.xlsx} document
#'
#' Takes a \code{gtsummary} table object and exports it to to a \code{.xlsx}
#' document, using the \code{huxtable} and \code{openxlsx} libraries.
#'
#' @param gtsummary_tbl A table created with the \code{gtsummary} package.
#' @param wb_path Path to the .xlsx document. If it does not yet exist, it will
#' be created.
#' @param sheet_name Name of the sheet this table will receive, once entered
#' into the \code{.xlsx} document. If \code{FALSE}, it will be labelled by its
#' sheet number in the resulting document (i.e., if the document already has
#' two sheets, this new table's sheet name will be "Sheet 3"). Note, this param
#' intentionally received no default, to make it difficult for the user to
#' quickly dump a bunch of tables into a .xlsx document. Although this is easy
#' to do at the time or export, it tends to make it much harder for the
#' recipient to understand what is happening in a large document. For that
#' reason, if the user truly wants the convenience, the need to declare it
#' explicitly by setting this param to \code{FALSE}.
#' @param add_date If \code{TRUE}, a date be appended to the end of the file
#' name (\code{wb_path}) before export. For example, 'my_path.xlsx' will become
#' something like 'my_path_2020_01_25.xlsx' (using Sys.Date() for today's date).
#' @param overwrite If \code{TRUE}, existing file will be overwritten by
#' openxlsx::saveWorkbook() - which does the exportation already under the hood.
#' Note, under normal circumstances you actually want this to be \code{TRUE}
#' because the current function first loads any existing workbook into memory,
#' then adds a sheet to it, then exports. So, if your goal is to ADD the current
#' table to an existing sheet (which is usually the case), \code{overwrite}
#' should probably be set to \code{TRUE}.
#'
#' @details
#' In theory, this function doesn't do much more than the existing
#' \code{gtsummary::as_hux_xlsx()} function. It's major contribution is a more
#' convenient workflow, which allows you to have a single filepath that you can
#' keep adding sheets to as an analysis (e.g., .Rmd document) expands. It also
#' has some convenience arguments to enhance the workflow
